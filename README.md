# ðŸŽ“ SGPA/CGPA Calculator

## What Sorcery Is This?

Born from the mystical realms of academia, this calculator transmutes your raw course grades into the sacred numbers known as SGPA and CGPA. Like Gandalf's staff illuminating the darkness, it brings clarity to the complex calculations of academic performance.

## Realms Where This Magic Works Best

Primarily crafted for the lands of:
- India (where the 10-point scale rules supreme)
- Engineering colleges under AICTE guidelines
- Universities following the UGC grading system

## Powers It Possesses

- Calculates SGPA with the precision of Elvish craftsmen
- Forges CGPA across multiple semesters
- Converts GPAs to percentages (using the legendary 9.5 multiplier)
- Switches between light and dark themes like day and night in LothlÃ³rien
- Shows proper grade points (O=10 to F=0) like ancient runes of knowledge

## ðŸš« What It Cannot Do

- Cannot predict future grades (we're calculators, not PalantÃ­rs)
- Won't hack into university systems to change grades
- Cannot convert grades from other realms (US 4.0 scale, UK's First Class system)
- Won't write your assignments (that's your quest to bear)
